    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> To prepare a simple and delicious chicken recipe, start by marinating boneless chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, and your favorite spices—such as paprika, cumin, or turmeric—for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to soak in. Heat some oil in a pan over medium heat, then add the marinated chicken and cook for about 6–8 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked and golden brown. For added flavor, you can sauté onions and tomatoes in the same pan and let them simmer with the chicken. Serve the dish hot with rice, naan, or a side of vegetables for a complete and satisfying meal.
